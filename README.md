# Section 2 Activity
In this assignment, we will practice what we’ve learned so far about Java input, output, and variables.

Edit the [Hello_World.java](src/Hello_World.java) file to complete the following requirements:

1. Ask the user for their name and store it into a variable
2. Produce an output command based on the input the user entered
3. Make sure errors cleared before submitting.

## Sample Output
When run, the program should look similar to this:

```
Please enter your name:  Jennifer 
Hello, Jennifer! 
```

```Jennifer``` in the output above is typed by the user.

## Hints
If you need a refresher on how to work with variables or how to use the input and output commands, refer to video lessons 2.2-2.4 or the material posted in Google Classroom.
